# Spring Boot CRUD Operations API

## Overview

This project demonstrates **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL** as the database. It provides a simple RESTful API for managing resources, allowing basic operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

This project is ideal for understanding how to structure a Spring Boot application with **Spring Data JPA** and how to interact with a relational database using MySQL.

## Features

- **Create** new records in the database.
- **Read** existing records or retrieve a single record by its ID.
- **Update** details of existing records.
- **Delete** records by ID.
- **REST API** to perform all operations over HTTP.

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the REST API.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and database operations.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to store the data.
- **Hibernate**: JPA implementation used under the hood by Spring Data JPA.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and building the project.
